# Analysis-of-Gene-Expression-Data
A gene is a stretch of DNA inside the cell that tells the cell how to make a specific protein. All cells in the body contain the same genes, but the genes have different expression levels in different cell types, and cells canregulate gene expression levels in response to their environment. Many diseases, including cancer, fundamentally involve breakdowns in the regulation of gene expression. The expression profile of cancer cells becomes abnormal, and different kinds of cancers have different expression profiles. Our data are gene expression measurements from cells drawn from 64 different tumors (from 64 different patients). In each case, a device called a microarray (or gene chip) measured the expression of each of 6830 distinct genes, essentially the logarithm of the chemical concentration of the geneâ€™s product. Thus, each record in the data set is a vector of length 6830. The cells mostly come from known cancer types, so there are classes, in addition to the measurements of the expression levels. The classes are breast, cns (central nervous system), colon, leukemia, melanoma, nsclc (non-small cell lung cancer), ovarian, prostate, renal, K562A, K562B, MCF7A, MCF7D (those three are laboratory tumor cultures) and unknown.
